          <h2>Troll by</h2>
          <p>
            Kristiansand is one of the most beautiful cities in Norway, located
            on the southern coast where the Baltic Sea meets the North Sea.
            Founded in 1641 by King Christian IV, the city has preserved its
            charm and traditional Scandinavian character.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The city center, known as Kvadraturen, is a unique district built on
            a rectangular street grid. The narrow streets, lined with houses
            featuring colorful wooden facades, are perfect for strolling. This
            is where most of the city's cultural landmarks are concentrated:
          </p>
          <br />
          <dl class="list size">
            <li>
              The neo-Gothic Kristiansand Cathedral. Its high spires are visible
              from afar, and inside, a unique atmosphere of peace and
              tranquility awaits.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 17th-century Christiansholm Fortress, built to protect the
              city from naval attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fiskebrygga – a place where you can taste the freshest seafood
              dishes. In summer, the area is lively with cozy outdoor cafes, and
              boat trips depart from the quay.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of the city's oldest areas, Posebyen, where wooden houses from
              the 18th and 19th centuries have been preserved. Walking here
              feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by the quiet charm of
              old streets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kristiansand Zoo and Amusement Park – the largest in Norway and a
              true pride of the city. It is home to animals from around the
              world, and nearby, there is a water park and attractions for the
              whole family.
            </li>
          </dl>
          <br />
          <p>
            As you wander along the sandy beaches and central streets of the
            city, you will feel the soul of Southern Norway – calm yet bright
            and vibrant.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But what truly makes this city special is its secret side. In fact,
            Kristiansand is home not only to humans but also to small trolls who
            have been part of the city's life for centuries.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The trolls are equal citizens of the city, just like humans. They
            live in crooked houses hidden among Kvadraturen’s narrow streets or
            under various bridges. Their homes are distinguished by slightly
            smaller doors and windows that glow with warm light even at night.
            The trolls walk the same streets as people but often remain
            invisible – unless you know where to look.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            These small inhabitants not only live peacefully alongside people
            but also help them. For example, they take care of small, overlooked
            corners of the city: repairing broken benches in parks, watering
            flowers in flower beds, or clearing tiny paths in green areas.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So if one day you stroll through Kristiansand, take a peek into the
            most unexpected corners – perhaps there, the trolls are holding a
            meeting or painting the tiny doors of their houses. And remember,
            this city thrives not only thanks to its human residents but also
            because of the small, kind trolls who are always nearby, even if you
            can’t see them.
