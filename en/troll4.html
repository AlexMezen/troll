          <h2>Slem Marli</h2>
          <p>
            In the amazing city of trolls, there lived an orphaned troll girl
            named Marleon. But everyone just called her Marli. She was the most
            famous little trickster, always coming up with pranks and mischief.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One day, the troll policeman Broks caught her red-handed – she was
            shooting at the city’s streetlights with a slingshot! He didn’t know
            what to do with her, so he took her to the police station. While he
            pondered how to deal with the situation, he fell asleep in his
            chair.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was Marli’s chance to escape, and without hesitation, she
            slipped out. But she decided not to go alone. At the police station,
            she found a little wild boar sitting in a cage, ready to become
            dinner that evening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marli took the boar, brought it home, and started taking care of it.
            She named it Nils, and soon, Nils became her loyal friend and part
            of her family.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Broks woke up and discovered that not only had Marli escaped,
            but she had also taken the wild boar that was meant to be dinner, he
            became furious. He felt both insulted and tricked, and he promised
            himself that he would find them no matter the cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every day, Broks tried to track them by following fresh tracks, but
            to no avail. Marli was quick and knew the city like the back of her
            hand, making her impossible to find.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, Broks heard rumors that Marli had been seen often in the
            Grim area. He decided to go there and search, and after a while, he
            found them.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as he got closer, he saw something unexpected: Marli and Nils
            were playing and laughing together, clearly happy and content. Broks
            realized that even though Marli was unruly and full of pranks, she
            had a good heart and an infectious joy that made her impossible to
            dislike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Broks felt a strange emotion. It wasn’t anger, but
            something that resembled understanding and compassion.
          </p>
          <p>
            He decided to leave them in peace. “Maybe Marli needs time and trust
            to learn,” he thought. “Sometimes care and love can do more than
            punishment.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And so, Broks quietly walked away, a small smile on his face, while
            Marli and Nils continued to play among the trees.
